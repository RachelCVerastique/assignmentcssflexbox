                Our purpose here at Fur Babies adoption is to find every animal that we rescue a good, loving home.
                We are a nonprofit organization. Any and all donations go towards the animals we rescue and house until they find
                their forever homes. Any monetary donations goes towards medical expenses for preventive care or any treatments the fur babies need during their intake.
                During their stay with us we make sure they are on heartworm and intestinal parasite prevention as well as a flea and tick prevention so they are
                good to go when they are adopted.
                We do not turn any animal down. Whether they need to be caught or someone is surrendering their pet we are available to take them in and provide them with
                what is necessary to be welcomed in to loving homes.
            </p>
